We will recap some MAL1 concepts and get started on deep learning. Literature: Chapter 10 (except the section on Backpropagation).

After today's lesson, I expect you to be able to:
• Distinguish between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning.
• Explain the core components of a neural network, including neurons, weights, and biases.
• Explain the purpose and functioning of activation functions, gradient descent, and loss functions.
• Implement basic neural network structures in Python, using Keras/TensorFlow and experiment with different activation functions and interpret their impacts on model training.
